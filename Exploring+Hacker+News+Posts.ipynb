    "There are two main goals in this project:\n",
    "* To determine which posts between the subjects Ask HN or Show HN receieve more comments\n",
    "* To determine what time of day has the biggest influence on number of comments\n",

    "There are also two side goals:\n",
    "* To determine which posts between the subjects Ask HN or Show HN receieve more points\n",

    "The points system is a little more complicated, and there is even an Ask HN [post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7809498) on the subject. For simplicity sake, we'll assume the points is equal to `upvotes - downvotes`"

Ask HM posts receive the most comments from the community, with almost double the number of comments compared to Show HM posts, and tend to have a greater chance of becoming viral. Show HM posts, however, receieve more points compared to Ask HM, though the averages are similar. To receive the most number of comments and points on an Ask HM post, you should post at 3PM EST, when the user-base is most active."
